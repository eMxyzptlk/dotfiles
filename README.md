# Shabka

Shabka (Arabic for Network) is a declarative congruent representation of
my workstations (desktops, and laptops), network devices and servers,
using [NixOS][1] for the Linux boxes, and [Nix][2] for the other
operating systems.

I use [home-manager][4] to setup the home directory of the users, for
both NixOS and the other operating systems.
