# Shabka

Shabka (Arabic for Network) is a declarative congruent representation of
my workstations (desktops, and laptops), network devices and servers.
It's based on the [NixOS][1] operating system, and uses
[home-manager][4] to setup the home directory of the users, for both
NixOS and the other operating systems, including Mac.

## What is "declarative congruent" system?

There are three system management methods that greatly depend on the
tools that you are using for managing these systems

### Divergence

Setting up and updating a system - be it a workstation or a server -
using manual installation, such as setting a new Mac, or by automated
methods such as `cloud-init` for CoreOS, constitutes a divergent system.
It generally implies bad management of a system, as it diverge from the
baseline overtime and is hard to replicate in case of hardware or
software failure.

![Lisa 2002, Figure 1](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/lisa02/tech/full_papers/traugott/traugott_html/divergence.gif)

### Convergence

Convergence is the process of mutating a divergent live system back to the
baseline by comparing the state of the system to what the state of the
system should look like and performing automated actions to get the
system back to the baseline.

Puppet, Chef, Ansible and other similar tools follow the convergence
method of maintaining systems. These tools are also considered
declarative as they describe exactly how the system should look like.

![Lisa 2002, Figure 2](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/lisa02/tech/full_papers/traugott/traugott_html/convergence.gif)

### Congruence

Congruence is the practice of maintaining live hosts in complete
compliance with a declarative baseline of the system. In other words, a
congruent system is a system that you cannot alter without altering the
representation in order to make the changes that you are attempting.

![Lisa 2002, Figure 3](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/lisa02/tech/full_papers/traugott/traugott_html/congruence.gif)

### Conclusion

Working with a declarative baseline for an infrastructure (whatever the
indented use case of the machine or machines in your network) allows the
system to be replicated in a matter of minutes with no manual
configuration or missed steps. It also allows you to know, at any point,
what's the state of your entire infrastructure by simply reading the
declarative baseline of it.

There's an excellent paper by [Steve Traugott and Lance Brown][11] published
in 2002 that goes in details on all three methods.

My hopes with this project is to eliminate the constant need for manual
intervention in order to fix one of my broken machine, for whatever the
reason they broke. Even in the case of hardware failure, all I have to
do is to replace the hardware knowing full well that my entire system
can get back online by simply applying the baseline to a fresh machine
and restore the user data only.

## Why Nix?

[Nix][2] is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that
makes package management reliable and reproducible. It provides atomic
upgrades and rollbacks, side-by-side installation of multiple versions
of a package, multi-user package management and easy setup of build
environments. [Read more…][12]

Packages are built from Nix expressions, which is a simple functional
language. A Nix expression describes everything that goes into a package
build action (a “derivation”): other packages, sources, the build
script, environment variables for the build script, etc. Nix tries very
hard to ensure that Nix expressions are deterministic: building a Nix
expression twice should yield the same result.

Because it's a functional language, it's easy to support building
variants of a package: turn the Nix expression into a function and call
it any number of times with the appropriate arguments. Due to the
hashing scheme, variants don't conflict with each other in the Nix
store.

Nix has a large set of Nix expressions containing thousands of existing
Unix packages, in the [Nix Packages collection (Nixpkgs)][13].

## Why NixOS?

NixOS is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and
configuration management. Built on top of the [Nix package manager][2],
it is completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and has
[many other advantages][14].

Similar to Nix, NixOS is built upon the concept of atomic system updates
as well as rollbacks, and that includes the kernel and the initrd images
for early boot.

You simply cannot find yourself on a system that does not boot anymore,
provided the hardware is not defective and you have not broken GRUB or
Systemd-boot.

Please see the [NixOS about page][14] for a quick taste of managing a
NixOS system.

- default: `false`

When this option is enabled, the keyboard layout is set to Colemak in
early console (i.e initrd), the console and the Xorg server.

#### `mine.home-manager.config`

- type: Function
- default: `{ name, uid, isAdmin, nixosConfig }: {...}: {}`

This option is a function that takes `name`, `uid`, `isAdmin` and

system and debug it.

The host configuration, the modules and the options are inspired by
